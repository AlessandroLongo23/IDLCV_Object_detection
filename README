This is a project for the 3rd week of the course "Introduction to Deep Learning in Computer Vision" at the University of DTU.
We have been given a dataset of images containing street potholes, and we have to:
- first implement the selective search or box-based search algorithm to generate a list of bounding box proposals
- then build a CNN to detect the potholes

We also need to evaluate both the proposal generation algorithm and the CNN on the test set.
